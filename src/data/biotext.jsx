  "I was a Journalist before I became a developer. At the Danish School of Media and Journalism (DMJX) I learned the art of interviewing and crafting compelling stories for target audiences.",
  "Having a passion for telling the most complex stories I could find, I specialised in Tech Journalism. Soon I was working with leading organisations such as the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Nordic Blockchain Association and KPMG in communicating technological advancements to large audiences and target stakeholders.",
  "But I wanted to understand tech beyond storytelling. Fueling this ambition, I pursued a competetive Master's Degree in Software Development at the IT University of Denmark (ITU). As I delved deeper into computer science covering topics like front- and backend development, database management, information security and algorithms I transformed into a software engineer.",
  "Quickly I started working as a frontend developer. As of today, I have contributed developing websites and applications for large organisations such as tamigo, Templafy and Bankdata. My role in these projects covers everything from responsive web development to project management to manipulating and visualising data from relational databases.",
  "Today, I thrive as a software developer at IT Minds, taking on exciting projects for leading organisations. I also enjoy staying up to date with the advantages of using the newest technologies and frameworks doing varios hobby projects. Currently Iâ€™m learning how to develop using TypeScript, C# and the .net platform as well as using artificial intelligence in web applications.",
